# Quantum computing demo

This demo took place in front of the Credit Decision team at Qred Bank AB on February 28, 2025.

The notebook contains an example of a quantum circuit, consisting of a Toffoli gate (which is the quantum equivalent of the traditional logic "AND"). To run the notebook flawlessly, the environment should be based on Python 3.10, with Qiskit 0.39.5 installed.
